# Hi there, I'm Niklas! ðŸ˜€

Hello, I am Niklas Wild and come from Germany. I have been fascinated by technology since I was a child and started programming at the age of 11. The world of computer science fascinates me in every way and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to develop my skills.

The projects I am currently working on are always pinned. But you can also find other great projects on my GitHub.

You can find all my links on [Linktree].
