# Hi there, I'm Niklas! 😀

Hello, I am Niklas Wild and come from Germany. I have been fascinated by technology since I was a child and started programming at the age of 11. The world of computer science fascinates me in every way and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to develop my skills.
